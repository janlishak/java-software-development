The assignment:

You must design and implement the Kingdom simulation shown. The ultimate goal is to get valuables, so
the king can throw parties.

The King has a Treasure room (lower left corner) with the door guarded buy a Guardsman. The valuables in
the Treasure room comes from a Mine (upper right corner) with Miners transporting their findings to a
Deposit (lower right corner). Occasionally, Valuable Transporters are moving valuables from Deposit to the
Treasure room and Accountants are counting all valuables in the Treasure room. When the King feels like
partying, he takes valuables from the Treasure room if there are enough for a party.

Requirements
* Threads to simulate the actors: King, Accountants, ValuableTransporter and ValuablesMiner.
* Singleton to log any action, e.g. when an actor waits or perform a job.
* Flyweight for different types of Valuables, e.g. Diamond, GoldNugget, Jewel, Ruby, WoodenCoin.
* JUnit testing an ArrayList to be used in the Deposit.
* Documentation: http://ict-engineering.dk/javadoc/MyArrayList/
* Jar file: http://ict-engineering.dk/jar/MyArrayList-0.1.jar
* Adapter for the ArrayList in the Deposit.
* Producer-Consumer for the Deposit with the Miners and Valuables Transporters being producers
and consumers, respectively.
* Readers-Writers for the Treasure room and Guardsman.
* Proxy between the Treasure room and the Guardsman.
