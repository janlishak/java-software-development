Exercise:Extra features for the "chat" systemChange the"Chat"-exercise (Exercise 09.01)such that you
Add a login (username). Define protocol, update client and server.
Server logs username and ip with the messages
Change the server to store logs in a file.
How and when is up to you.
Change the serve not to allow flooding
(the same message being send more than 5 times). Either disconnect or another way
to handle it
Create another thread on the client side (a recieverThread).
This one is created and started by the ClientHandle. The recieverThread waits for incoming messages
in an infinite loop and just print out the message.
Let the server send a message, e.g. after login, if flooding or a random time.
